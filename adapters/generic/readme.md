## The OAS Contract Generic Adapter Package

### Meaning & Naming 

`OASGenericAdapter` does convey the intended meaning that it is a programmatic object wrapper designed to serve as an intermediary between OpenAPI Specification (OAS) JSON definitions and the consumer. Here's how it communicates that:

- OAS: Clearly indicates that the adapter is related to OpenAPI Specifications, making it evident what type of definitions it works with.
- Generic: Suggests that the adapter is versatile and can handle a range of use cases, which aligns with your intention of it being universal.
- Adapter: Implies that it serves to bridge the gap between the OAS definitions and the consumers, transforming or facilitating interaction with the underlying data.
