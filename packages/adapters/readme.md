Both **`OASGenericAdapter`** and **`ContractOutletAdapter`** can be meaningful when used together for external consumers, but they convey slightly different aspects of your architecture. Hereâ€™s how they complement each other:

1. **`OASGenericAdapter`**:
   - This name suggests a broad, versatile adapter that handles the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) definitions. It implies that it can work with various definitions and provide a general interface for interacting with them.
   - It positions itself as the primary means of adapting the OAS definitions for consumer use.

2. **`ContractOutletAdapter`**:
   - This name focuses on the specific role of facilitating access to the operations, routes, parameters, and responses defined within a contract. It indicates that it provides a point of access or outlet for the underlying OAS definitions.
   - It suggests a more specialized functionality, complementing the generic nature of the `OASGenericAdapter`.

### Overall Meaningfulness
- Together, these names imply a layered architecture where **`OASGenericAdapter`** serves as a foundational adapter for OAS definitions, while **`ContractOutletAdapter`** provides a more targeted interface for accessing specific elements of those definitions.
- This distinction can help external consumers understand the relationship between the two components: one as a broad adapter for the specifications and the other as a specialized interface for the contract details.

### Consideration
- Ensure that the documentation and any accompanying descriptions clearly outline how these two components interact and their specific roles. This will enhance the clarity of their meaning and purpose to external consumers.
